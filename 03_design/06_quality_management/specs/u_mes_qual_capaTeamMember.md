## Structure

Child collection. The parent CAPA can have several lines of this kind, and DATA-001 does not allow an array inside the parent, so each line is its own document. capaId and capaName point to the parent.
Data class (transaction) and site are inherited from the parent. Documents are created, changed and removed together with the parent's lifecycle.

## Field dictionary

Every key is present in every document. "Required" means the value may not be null. Date tag: Date = calendar date stored as 00:00:00 local plant time; Datetime = local plant time stored with the +0000 suffix (no UTC conversion).
