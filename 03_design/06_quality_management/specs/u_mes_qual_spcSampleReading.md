| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | QualityManagement (qual) |
| Purpose | One document per reading value of a SPC sample |
| Kind | Value list |
| Data class | Transaction |
| Parent collection | u_mes_qual_spcSample |
| _id pattern | 16-digit numeric string, unique across the database |
| Display value used by references | recordNo |
| Keys | 16 (16 required, 0 may be null) |

## Structure

Value-list collection. A SPC sample can have several values of this kind, and DATA-001 does not allow an array, so each value is its own document. spcSampleId and spcSampleName point to the parent.
Data class (transaction) and site are inherited from the parent. Documents are created, changed and removed together with the parent's lifecycle.

## Field dictionary

Every key is present in every document. "Required" means the value may not be null. Date tag: Date = calendar date stored as 00:00:00 local plant time; Datetime = local plant time stored with the +0000 suffix (no UTC conversion).
