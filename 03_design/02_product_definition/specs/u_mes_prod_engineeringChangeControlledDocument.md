# u_mes_prod_engineeringChangeControlledDocument

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | Product Definition (prod) |
| Purpose | Links one engineering change to one controlled document; one document per link |
| Kind | Relationship |
| Data class | Transaction |
| Parent collection | u_mes_prod_engineeringChange |
| _id pattern | 16-digit numeric string, unique across the database |
| Display value used by references | recordNo |
| Keys | 17 (17 required, 0 may be null) |

## Structure

Relationship collection. A engineering change can be linked to several documents of another collection, and DATA-001 does not allow an array of IDs, so each link is its own document carrying one singular reference pair. engineeringChangeId and engineeringChangeName point to the parent.
Data class (transaction) and site are inherited from the parent. Documents are created, changed and removed together with the parent's lifecycle.

## Field dictionary

Every key is present in every document. "Required" means the value may not be null. Date tag: Date = calendar date stored as 00:00:00 local plant time; Datetime = local plant time stored with the +0000 suffix (no UTC conversion).
